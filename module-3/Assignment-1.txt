Unity3D VR Scene Setup

Objective: Get familiar with Unity3D and set up a basic VR scene.

Instructions:

Background:
Unity3D is a powerful platform for developing virtual reality applications, and familiarity with its tools and workflows is essential for virtual reality developers. In this assignment, you will create a simple VR scene in Unity3D, integrating either the Oculus or SteamVR integration package. This assignment will help you become comfortable with Unity3D and establish the foundation for developing VR experiences.

Task:

Select VR Platform: Choose one of the following VR platforms to work with: Oculus or SteamVR. Ensure that you have the necessary hardware and software installed to develop for the chosen platform.

Scene Creation: Create a new Unity3D project for VR development. Set up a basic VR scene with the following elements:

a. Objects: Add at least three 3D objects (e.g., cubes, spheres, or custom models) to your VR scene. These objects will serve as elements within the virtual environment.

b. Camera Rig: Set up the VR camera rig for tracking and movement. Configure the camera rig to allow for VR interactions, such as head tracking and controller input.

c. Player Movement: Implement a basic player movement system that allows users to explore the virtual environment. You can use locomotion techniques such as teleportation or smooth movement, depending on your chosen VR platform.

Integration Package: Integrate the Oculus or SteamVR SDK/package into your Unity project, depending on your selected VR platform. Ensure that the necessary components and prefabs are imported and configured correctly.

Testing: Test your VR scene using a compatible VR headset. Ensure that the scene functions as intended, with proper tracking, object interaction, and movement controls. Pay attention to any issues or glitches and document them.

Documentation: Create a documentation file that includes the following information:

a. Platform Selection: Mention the VR platform you chose to work with (Oculus or SteamVR) and explain your reasons for selecting it.

b. Scene Description: Describe the virtual environment you created, including the objects, camera rig setup, and player movement controls.

c. Testing Experience: Share your experience testing the VR scene using a VR headset. Document any challenges faced or improvements made during testing.

Reflection: Write a brief reflection on your experience with Unity3D and VR scene setup. Discuss the importance of proper VR scene setup for delivering a seamless VR experience.

Submission: Submit your documentation electronically through the course's online platform by the specified due date.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your Unity3D VR Scene Setup assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Scene Setup: The completeness and functionality of your VR scene in Unity3D, including object placement, camera rig configuration, and player movement controls.

Documentation: The completeness and clarity of your documentation, including scene description, testing experience, and platform selection rationale.

Testing Experience: The effectiveness of your testing and the ability to identify and document any issues or improvements needed.

Reflection: Thoughtful reflection on the importance of proper VR scene setup and its impact on the VR user experience.

Platform Selection: Clear explanation of your choice of VR platform (Oculus or SteamVR) and reasons for selection.
